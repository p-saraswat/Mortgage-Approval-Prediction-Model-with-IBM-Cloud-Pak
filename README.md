## Project Summary:

Data fabric serves as a backbone for knowledge discovery. It maps data residing in disparate applications — within the underlying data stores, regardless of original deployment designs and locations — and makes them ready for business exploration.

IBM Cloud Pak for Data is a data and AI platform with a data fabric architecture that makes all data available for AI and analytics, on any cloud. 
For demonstration, we have a business use case of a bank and we are creating a mortgage approval model that avoids unanticipated risk and treats all applicants fairly. To build a model and automatically capture metadata that tracks the model in an AI Factsheet we are utilizing the data from DataFabric warehouse offered by IBM and building the model using Python Jupyter Notebooks in IBM’s cloud Pak for Data.

The target audience is all organizations that have fragmented data assets and that rely on timely insights and decisions for their business growth.
We will also present the database design technology, data fabric and will compare with other database design technologies we have covered so far in class. 

We will be using GoldenBank Data that lives in DB2 on IBM Server and the tools/technologies we used are IBM Cloud Pak for data, Watson Machine Learning, Watson Open Scale, IBM cloud storage, DataFabric, Watson Studio

## Setup Instructions and Cloning the Repository:

1. Create account on IBM Cloud Pak for Data
2. Add services needed as per use case requirement. We used the following services for the Mortgage Approval Model:
  1. Watson Studio
  2. Watson Open Scale
  3. Watson Machine Learning
  4. Cloud Object Storage
  5. Knowledge Catalog
3. Take a tutorial to understand the platform and services
4. Create the project and add data to the Cloud Object Storage
5. You are ready for your project -  run analysis, deploy model, collaborate with your teammates!
